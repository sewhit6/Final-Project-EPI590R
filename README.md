# Information about the dataset
Central Park Squirrel Census
Squirrel data! The data this week comes from the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census.

The Squirrel Census is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project focusing on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis). They count squirrels and present their findings to the public. The dataset contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans.

The following information is steps that need to be taken to properly run this dataset that are not explicitly outlined in the Quarto document. 

Step 1:
Download the CSV squirrel_data file from the following website: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2023/2023-05-23/readme.md 

Step 2: This script can also be forked from my github repo by clicking the fork button, copying the HTTPS link under the green Code button, and running it in the RStudio terminal. 

Step 3: See .gitignore for things you may not want to push to your public repository and the README.md file (this file) for instructions on usage. 

Step 4: Render the quarto document by clicking "Render" in the banner of the source file. This should open the quarto document as an html in your browser.
